# substitution-cipher
Substitution cipher is a method of cryptography. </br>
This program encrypt a message by replacing every letter with another letter. (HW from online course CS50) </br>
To decrypt the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key (a mapping of every alphabet). </br>
Reverse process: translate ciphertext (the encrypt text) into plaintext (original one). </br>
</br>
For example, a key might be the string "POMAFTHRLZGECYJIUWSKDVBNQX"</br>
This 26-character key means that A (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into P (the first character of the key), Z should be converted into X (the last character of the key), and so forth.</br>
A message like **HELLO**, then, would be encrypted as **RFEEJ**.
